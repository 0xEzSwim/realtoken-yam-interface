Please note that CSM tokens have a whitelist of approved addresses for interaction. Any transaction of these tokens to a non-whitelisted address will fail. We kindly request you to register on Mt Pelerin and complete your KYC, and then contact the CleanSat Mining support team for validation. If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation.\n\nThe CleanSat Mining Team"
